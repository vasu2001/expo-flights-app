# Flight Results UI Implementation

This document describes the flight results UI implementation for the Expo Flights App.

## Components Created

### 1. FlightResultCard (`components/ui/flight-result-card.tsx`)
A reusable component that displays individual flight results in a card format matching the design from the image description.

**Features:**
- Destination image on the left (using Unsplash API for placeholder images)
- Flight details on the right including:
  - Destination city name
  - Travel dates (departure and return)
  - Flight route visualization with stops and duration
  - Price display in Indian Rupees (â‚¹)
- Pressable for navigation to flight details

**Props:**
- `flight: FlightItinerary` - The flight data to display
- `onPress?: () => void` - Optional callback when card is pressed

### 2. FlightResultsList (`components/ui/flight-results-list.tsx`)
A container component that manages the display of multiple flight result cards.

**Features:**
- Loading state with spinner and message
- Empty state with helpful message
- Results header showing count and "About these results" text
- Scrollable list of flight result cards
- Handles flight press events

**Props:**
- `flights: FlightItinerary[]` - Array of flights to display
- `isLoading: boolean` - Loading state
- `onFlightPress?: (flight: FlightItinerary) => void` - Callback for flight selection

## Integration with Main App

### Updated HomeScreen (`app/(app)/index/index.tsx`)
The main search screen has been updated to include:

1. **State Management:**
   - Added `hasSearched` state to track when search has been performed
   - Integrated with existing flight search query

2. **Layout Changes:**
   - Changed from single ScrollView to View with nested ScrollView
   - Added conditional flight results section below search form

3. **Sample Data Integration:**
   - Uses sample flight data for development (since API has limited requests)
   - Falls back to real API data when available

4. **Navigation:**
   - Added flight press handler that navigates to flight details page
   - Uses Expo Router for navigation

## Sample Data

### Flight Search Response (`api/flight-client/sample-response.ts`)
Added comprehensive sample flight data including:

- 3 sample flights with different destinations (Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad)
- Varied pricing, durations, and stop counts
- Realistic flight information with proper TypeScript types
- Filter statistics for future filtering features

## Flight Details Page

### FlightDetailsScreen (`app/(app)/index/flight-details.tsx`)
A placeholder flight details page that:

- Receives flight ID as route parameter
- Displays basic flight information
- Provides navigation back to search results
- Ready for future enhancement with detailed flight information

## Design Features

### Visual Design
- **Dark Theme:** Matches the dark background shown in the image
- **Card Layout:** Clean, modern card design with rounded corners
- **Image Integration:** Dynamic destination images from Unsplash
- **Typography:** Proper hierarchy with bold destination names and muted secondary text
- **Flight Route Visualization:** Custom flight path icon with dots and lines

### Responsive Layout
- **Flexible Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Proper Spacing:** Consistent padding and margins
- **Scrollable Content:** Handles long lists of flight results

## Usage

1. **Search Flights:** Fill out the search form and tap "Search Flights"
2. **View Results:** Flight results appear below the search form
3. **Select Flight:** Tap any flight card to view details
4. **Navigate Back:** Use the back button to return to search results

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real API Integration:** Replace sample data with actual API calls
2. **Filtering:** Add filters for price, duration, stops, etc.
3. **Sorting:** Add sorting options (price, duration, departure time)
4. **Flight Details:** Enhance the flight details page with comprehensive information
5. **Booking Flow:** Add booking functionality
6. **Favorites:** Allow users to save favorite flights
7. **Price Alerts:** Set up price drop notifications

## Technical Notes

- **TypeScript:** Fully typed with proper interfaces
- **React Native:** Uses native components for optimal performance
- **Expo Router:** Handles navigation between screens
- **NativeWind:** Styling with Tailwind CSS classes
- **React Query:** Manages API state and caching
